#### Description

The main objective of this project is to apply a Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCNN) in a quad-drone. The drone identifies a person with specific features (red t-shirt in this case). Recognition is possible by training the FCNN with images from a data set. The data input comes from a drone that captures images from simulated open space.

The project runs in a unity simulation, Where it is possible to control a quad-drone that can be moved freely in the simulated open space. I set up a pattern that the drone will follow to capture images for recognition. After that, I set up spawning points where the multitude appears. The objective appears in the simulated crowd, which corresponds to the noise in the model.
